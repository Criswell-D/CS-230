Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room was interested in developing a game, Draw It or Lose It. They needed to have the game to be available on mulitple platforms. The game needed to be able to be saved so it could be returned to if needed. The game is a team based game, so mulitle players needed to be able to play in a game. They needed it to be a web based game.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I feel that I was able to take the information given about the client and their needs to create a document that could have been used by a real client. Only using the information available was limiting, more information could have been helpful but I worked well with what I was given.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  Knowing exactly what the client wanted and what their needs were made it easier to know how to develop the application. Having the information before helped plan for the needs of the project. It also helped reduce any questions I may have had because I could look at the document for an answer first.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would revise the Evaluation section. I think the information could be structured in a better way. I would either make the information bullet points or organize the paragraphs in a better way.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  We used different UI's for different platforms. Since the game was developed to be played on different platforms we needed to implement designs for different screen sizes and touch screens. User's are the ones using the product, developing with them in mind helps to show a level of care and concern for them. Without the user there would be no one to produce for or pay for the product.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

 I would use a design document like the one created for this project. I think the document helped me to get the information I needed to develop for the client. I also think it is helpful for the client because they might not have an exact idea of what they are looking for and this document would be an exercise for them in making a final decision on the project. I approached designing software with an open mind. I feel I was able to take the information I was learning and use it to help me be succesful as a developer.
